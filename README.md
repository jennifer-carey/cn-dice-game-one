# Dice game - 1 player

## About the project

This interactive dice game was built on a solo project during my 12-week coding bootcamp with Code Nation. We were given a brief which included rules for the game.

Rules of the game...
- Roll the dice to begin the game.
- When a dice is rolled, the score adds up.
- Once the score passed, 20, you win.
- However, if you hit ‘1’ then you automatically lose.
